  # Note: rag-service, auth-service, and ui-service don't expose /metrics endpoints

  # Note: Redis and PostgreSQL don't expose Prometheus metrics directly

  # - redis_exporter for Redis metrics
  # - postgres_exporter for PostgreSQL metrics
  # For now, these are commented out to avoid connection warnings

  # - job_name: 'redis'
  #   static_configs:
